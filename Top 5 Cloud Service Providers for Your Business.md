It's no surprise that cloud computing is becoming an integral part of business operations. The advantages it provides allow companies to remain competitive and eliminate the need to purchase a server. While there are many providers available, GCP seems to be the frontrunner. Choosing the right cloud service provider can make or break a business in this day and age.

## What are cloud services?
Cloud services are hosted on the internet and accessed through the internet. Itâ€™s the same concept as hosting websites, but cloud computing provides new and powerful options. With the help of a cloud service provider, companies can save time and money by not having to purchase or maintain additional hardware or software. Depending on the size of their project or business needs, they can also scale up or down on demand. Furthermore, cloud services offer tremendous flexibility and scalability, allowing businesses to securely store data in the cloud and easily access it from anywhere in the world. Cloud services are overgrowing as more businesses understand the advantages they offer.

## What Exactly are PaaS & IaaS?

1. PaaS
PaaS stands for "Platform as a Service." It is a cloud computing service that provides a platform for developers to build, run, and manage web applications and services without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. PaaS providers usually handle server infrastructure, storage, and scaling tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing code and deploying their applications. Examples of PaaS providers include Heroku, AWS, and Microsoft Azure App Service.

2. IaaS
IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. It is a category of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. IaaS providers offer these resources on-demand, allowing customers to scale up or down their usage as needed. This enables businesses to avoid the capital expense of building and maintaining their data centers and instead pay for the resources they use on a pay-as-you-go basis. GCP, Amazon Web Services(AWS), Microsoft Azure,are examples of IaaS providers.

## Why do you Require a Cloud Service Provider?
Cloud computing provides numerous critical advantages for keeping up with the technological curve of modern-day applications. Here are a few benefits of how cloud computing can help your business:

1. Efficient & Cost Effective
With cloud services, businesses can save on hardware and software investments and energy costs. Moreover, since cloud services allow companies to store their data online, IT infrastructure costs are reduced significantly. This helps save money and eliminates the need for physical storage space. By leveraging the power of cloud services, businesses become more efficient and cost-effective.

2. Access to Powerful Software Applications
Cloud computing also gives businesses access to powerful software applications. Companies can use SaaS to gain access to software applications that can help them automate processes and increase productivity. Businesses can use PaaS to gain access to development tools that will assist them in creating custom applications. In addition, with IaaS, businesses can gain access to compute infrastructure resources that can help them scale their operations.

3. Improved Security
Cloud services are essential for businesses that prioritize data security and privacy. Many cloud service providers offer robust security tools to protect businesses from unauthorized access, malware, and cyber threats. In addition to protecting data, cloud services can help enterprises to comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR. This allows companies to operate with confidence knowing their data is securely stored.

4. Scalability & Flexibility
Cloud services are providing organizations with unprecedented scalability and flexibility. They can quickly increase or decrease computing power and storage capacity based on the changing needs of the business. This allows companies to be more agile in responding to customer demands and developing innovative products faster. Cloud services also provide a reliable platform for businesses to store their data and applications securely.

## Types of Cloud Service Providers

When it comes to cloud service providers, there are two main types: public cloud providers and private cloud providers.

1. Public Clouds
Public cloud providers offer a wide range of cloud services to the public. These services can scale up and down quickly, providing access to the latest technology with fast response time and reliable performance. Businesses can minimise IT expenditures and focus on their core capabilities by leveraging common infrastructure. Examples of popular public cloud providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. These cloud service providers provide a secure platform for businesses to store, process, and manage their data and applications in the cloud. Furthermore, these companies offer additional services such as analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, which can help businesses stay ahead of their competitors in this ever-changing world.

2. Private Clouds
Private cloud providers provide tailored cloud services to businesses, which offer greater control and flexibility compared to the benefits of a public cloud. These services are hosted on an entire infrastructure and available only to those who have an agreement with the provider. This ensures that the cloud service remains secure and private. Examples of private cloud providers include IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Rackspace. These companies provide the most comprehensive and secure cloud services to businesses, ensuring maximum performance and reliability of their cloud services.

## Best Cloud Service Providers
Cloud computing's capabilities have grown nearly limitless thanks to the internet. Choosing the best provider for your needs can be challenging with so many options. We clearly like GCP, and we intend to make the case for it here, but there are times when other options are preferable.

1. Google Cloud Platform
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a> is one of the popular cloud service providers. It offers many cloud services, from SaaS applications to PaaS development tools. It also provides enterprise-grade features such as security, compliance, and scalability. An important consideration is price performance. It cannot be easy to compare one vCPU to another from a different company, but Google consistently outperforms in price comparisons and uptime. GCP is built for engineers by world-class engineers. They are on the cutting edge of technologies to put out to the public. GCP keeps its offering at the appropriate level of complexity by deprecating tools when better alternatives emerge. Google entered the cloud computing market a bit later than some other companies. They took time to decide if they should offer cloud services to others. This is why Amazon Web Services (AWS) had a big lead on them. Google has now fully committed to providing cloud services and caught up with others except for the number of developers using their services.

2. Amazon Web Services
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> is the most popular platform for startups and businesses in general.It provides various features, such as elasticity and reliability, making it an ideal choice for businesses of all sizes. AWS also offers a variety of pricing options, making it an attractive option for companies looking to save money. Since Amazon is more mature than others, it has come out with some advanced features earlier than others, but it's usually best not to be using advanced cloud features, since you want to avoid lock in as much as possible. It's less committed to engineering excellence than Google or even Microsoft. Some products could be clearer on AWS because they rarely deprecate or remove options.

3. Microsoft Azure
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure</a> is the third biggest cloud service provider. It  has enterprise-level features like security and compliance. Azure is less popular for general-purpose computing applications and less feature-rich than GCP and AWS. You would mainly use Azure to easily integrate with other Microsoft products, such as Office 365 or Windows OS-based tools.

4. Heroku
<a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> has undoubtedly been an excellent choice for many developers when it comes to working with Ruby on Rails apps. Heroku is great, to begin with, but as soon as you hit a certain point, Heroku can become quite expensive. Therefore, if you are looking for an easy and cheap way to deploy a toy project - Heroku is a great option, but as soon as your project starts increasing in size, you should consider other options.

5. IBM Cloud
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud">IBM Cloud</a>, formerly known as IBM Bluemix, is a cloud computing platform provided by IBM. IBM Cloud provides various services such as computing, storage, networking, databases, analytics, artificial intelligence, security, and Internet of Things (IoT) services. IBM Cloud also provides several tools for developing, deploying, and managing applications, including a web-based console, command-line interface, and APIs.
